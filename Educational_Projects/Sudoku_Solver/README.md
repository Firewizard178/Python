# Sudoku Solver 
This is a [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim) tutorial at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kE3aF6Y0wNBNih7hWRAU2o)
Excludes the GUI Section

## Description and Examples
I'm using the first example at [this link](https://sandiway.arizona.edu/sudoku/examples.html)

This project is a sudoku solver using the [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms#cite_note-difficult_17_clue-1) algorithm

## Further Improvements (My own ideas)
Make it easier to change your board 

Try and make a gui that allows the user to input, edit or delete values from the empty squares and show the process of the backtracking taking place
